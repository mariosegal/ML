ML
==
This is repository for the exercise files and other related files (like data files) from the coursera ML Class by Andrew NG in Spring 2013.

Feel free to use it as needed, of course you are not expected to see others code as per the honor code.

I tried to vectorize whenever possible, but there are some instances where I used loops due to lack of time or skill
